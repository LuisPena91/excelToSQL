This code takes the information from an excel sheet and paste in a SQL data base.
Give the user the option to:
* Select the database and the table to update.
* Select the excel sheet when the information is.
* Relate every single excel column to a SQL column.
* And see which information was updated and which was just added

It is importatn have in mind that the SQL database and tables had to be ready to use with the propper format configuration to receive the data.

- This was developed using python and pandas libraries.
- The database and DDL codes are in MySQL.
- The database credentials (localhost) are storage in microsoft enviroment, the system will ask for the database name. 

### Currently I'm still working in the app, managing errors.
